											<td><b>An Empty Café</b></td>
											<td>The old man ignored the question, and sipped his tea. Autumn fell around him in a multitude of colours, but peculiarly, today felt special for some reason he couldn’t quite explain. The sea was gentle this afternoon, and as he sat in the same seat (drinking the same drink), the sounds of the sun wafted along his street—a bicycle’s bell as it rode past; a street painter’s brush strokes by the sea-side; a couple, giggling and laughing, the leaves under their feet cracking and crunching to the light rhythm of boots and cobblestone.  </td>

											<td><b>The Writer</b></td>
											<td>There is a town between somewhere and nowhere, where the sun never shines and the birds never sing. A single solitary man lives in the town- the town that does not exist. He is a writer who no longer writes, a leader too weak to lead, a brave man turned coward. He sleeps on a pile of long-forgotten dreams, surrounded by mountains of fool’s gold. He is but a shadow of his past self--too scared to move on. </td>

											<td><b>The Man in the Mirror</b></td>
											<td>There is a mirror, hanging above the doorway of our kitchen. (...) 
											The day my mother put it up, my father was out in the woods while my younger self held on to the kitchen chair that my mother stood on. She explained to me, after I had asked incredulously about such an odd place for a mirror that it was to prevent thieves from sneaking in through our backdoor. She told me, with a glint in her eye, that they would look in, see the man in the mirror, and run away in a fit of fear. I didn’t like this idea (I was scared of the mirrors) so I had told her it would never work, and that it was a stupid idea, and that I was going to do my homework and no mom I don’t need help.</td>

											<td><b>The Forest</b></td>
											<td>It is a chilly winter morning. Tall coniferous trees tower against the wide blue sky. A blanket of snow and glistening icicles shine in the early rising sun as the animals of the forest slowly begin to wake. The deer, some already up, cautiously poke their snouts in the soft snow for fresh grass to eat. Moose lumber through the forest, casually gnawing at leaves, taking in the Canadian winter. Rabbits hop all around the forest, looking for food, or just playing into the blanket of snow. For a moment, the forest is lively; yet quiet.  </td>
